# GenCertForNS
Generate an Let's Encrypt certificate you can user for your NetScaler.

Currently still Work In Progress... It's not yet finished.

The prerequisite is that you have an configured NetScaler (http) Content Switch vServer.
The script will present you with the required configuration rules (it will also be copied to your clipboard so you only have to copy it in the cli of the NetScaler)

More soon (I hope)...
